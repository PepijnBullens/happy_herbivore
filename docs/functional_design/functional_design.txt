-- Description

Happy Herbivore is a healthy vegan fast food chain and they are getting a new location in Hoog Catharijne. 
In this new location Harry Harper, who is in charge of the ICT-department and internal development in the Happy Herbivore team, 
wants a new self service kiosk system. Harry Harper and his development team are currently understaffed and thus very busy, which is why we are making it.
This system was inspired by the already massively used systems at other fast food chains like: 
McDonalds, KFC or the Amazing Oriental, which is where we have done our research for this project.

- What elements are there?
From our research one thing has become very clear, 
we want to attract customers with minimalistic but purpose driven visuals/designs.
As for the elements themselves we need a way for customers to navigate food categories and then select items.
We do this by adding a big scroll bar at the left side of the screen containing the categories with, once selected, clear visuals of the items next to it.
After the full order is selected the customer can click on a button displaying their total cost which then sends them to the payment screen.
We have discussed payment possibilities with Harry Harper and we came to the conclusion that he will be later handling the payment with a card.
This means we will be adding a delay once a confirm button has been clicked to simulate temporary payment processing.

- What is the purpose of these elements?
The purpose of these elements is to create a seamless and visually appealing ordering experience for customers. 
The minimalistic but purpose driven design helps attract customers while ensuring easy navigation through food categories. 
The scroll bar allows users to efficiently browse options, and the total cost button provides a clear way to proceed to payment

- How do these elements work?
The elements work by guiding the user through a structured ordering process. 
The scroll bar on the left side of the screen lets customers browse food categories, 
and selecting a category displays corresponding food items clearly. Once items are chosen, 
the total cost button allows users to review their order and proceed to the payment screen. 
Clicking the confirm button triggers a short delay to simulate payment processing before the manual card transaction is added by Harry Harpers development team.

-- Colors

We use the following colors:
Orange #ff7520
LightOrange #ffb181
Green #8cd003
LightGreen #deff78
DarkBlue #053631



-- images

We are going to use images given by Harry Harper. These images are generated to pop-out and show the user the "good looking" side of the products.
We also got cut-out versions of the products we use on other parts of the website which need to attract less information than the main content.

-- Usability

- What ideas have been devised for a user-friendly experience of the end product?
As previously mentioned we try to provide a clear path the customer can follow to achieve an easy, successful and fast order.
We do this by creating easy to read buttons, texts and an easy general layout to follow.



-- Target group research

- Which target group will use the final product?
After our research we have come to the conclusion that our target group is of all ages, but of course is mostly vegan.
We do think that the customer will mostly exist of people that don't have a lot of time since they are going to a "fast" food chain.
Which is why it's especially important that the kiosk system is self explanatory and fast to work (How we do this is explained in the previous parts of this document). 

- What are the characteristics of this target group?
After our research we noticed our future customers dont really have a lot of characteristics except for: being in a hurry and vegan.
We think this is enough to work with and makes it more than clear on how our designs should turn out.
