This video covers the whole use case walkthrough: `https://gluwebdev.notion.site/Use-case-18a69bb8092d801d9cd3f14ff993f9a5`
It also covers the extra analytics page.

But it leaves out a couple features, but we do have them: 
    multiple languages (dutch, english, german),
    a modal pop-up to warn the user if they want to reset their order while still having items in their cart,
    a modal pop-up if the user is 60 seconds inactive saying: 'Are you still there?' which after 10 seconds the user gets redirected back unless they interact with the screen again.
