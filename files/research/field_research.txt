- What is visible before you start placing an order?

A screen with the purpose of attracting customers. 

- How do you start an order, and are there different options at the start?

The order starts by clicking on "Order Here", you have the option to eat in the order place or to take-out. 
There also is an option to change the language of the procedure.

- How do you add an item to your order?

By searching for the item on the screen, this is done by scrolling through categories on the left and choosing an item in one of these categories.
When you click on an item you get a screen to determine what sides, sauces, other personalization options you want. Once this is chosen there is a big "Add to order" button to add the items to the order 
which only works if all personalization options are chosen.

- How do you remove an item from your order?

Once an item is added to the order you can click on the button "Your order" and see all the items in your order.
This allows you to remove an item by clicking on the trash can icon.

- How are the items displayed or located?

On the left side of the screen there is a vertical scrollbar which allows you to scroll through categories.
Once clicked on a category the items appear on the right side of the category bar.

- How does the interaction proceed? Do you only have to click, or is scrolling also possible?

You can vertically scroll on both the category bar and content items.

- How does the checkout process work?

Normally the customer is prompted with a payment by card. But Harry Harper has told us that another part of his company is handling the payment process. This means we are making a system where you can click on the "Your Order" page 
which shows another button with "Pay Now". Once clicked you go to a page which will handle the payment, in our case we have a 2 second delay which then confirms the payment.

- What does the design look like?

The design is very minimalistic and uses a strict corporate identity with predefined colors and style.

We are using the following colors provided by Harry Harper:

Orange #ff7520
LightOrange #ffb181
Green #8cd003
LightGreen #deff78
DarkBlue #053631

We are also going for a minimalistic and nature-like design which is inspired by the Happy Herbivore.

- What do the images and lettering look like?

They, just like the design, are minimalistic and are very much there for a reason. They attract the customers and show what they can expect.

- How is the image quality?

The image quality is high but compressed enough to not take too long to load.

- How big is the screen?

The screen is big enough to allow the user to see and interact with the items on the menu.

- What is the screen ratio and position?

The screen has a resolution of 1920x1080 but is displayed in a portrait mode.

- Where and how is the kiosk positioned in relation to its surroundings?

The screens are displayed in groups usually infront of the bar where the food is served.

- How many kiosks are present?

In our case (Amazing Oriental in Hoog Catharijne) there we're two pillars with both 4 displays. So in total 8 kiosk screens
